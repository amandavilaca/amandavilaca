`// That means "hello" in Portuguese!`
 
I'm a Tech student in Systems Analysis and Development with a BSc in Chemical Engineering, currently participating in a coding bootcamp focusing on web development.
Born and raised in Minas Gerais, Brazil, I moved to Bordeaux, France during college as an academic exchange student for a year. Having lived in another country and traveled to many others, I had the opportunity to discover many different places and cultures that made me who I am and gave me the chance to collect wonderful memories and meet extraordinary people. That's why I like to travel and learn languages such as English, French and Spanish.

If I'm not coding, I'm likely making coffee, reading, hiking or watching movies/documentaries. 

ðŸ’¡ Here it's all about the journey - I want to explore new challenges in a place where I can be my best self.
